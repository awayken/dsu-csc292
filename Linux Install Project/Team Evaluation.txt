My review of Lucas Michels:
The nice thing about Lucas was that he really wanted to learn what we were doing.  The bad parts were that he seemed to only absorb things when I told him outloud.  He didn't seem to believe in reading beforehand.  His questions were nice, they made him seem engaged, but they did tend to get annoying as I didn't have all the answers (because I was learning, too).

My review of Dustin Schroeder:
Dustin did a good job of documenting what we were doing, but he didn't seem to have a whole lot to input.  I had assigned him the job of doing the website, but I felt that there was a lot to be improved upon in it.  In all fairness, I couldn't think of a lot for him to do, but there wasn't much that he read up on or did on his own.
